#### description
I followed [this tutorial](https://medium.com/wehkamp-techblog/unit-testing-your-react-application-with-jest-and-enzyme-81c5545cee45), but it didn't give source code or which version of node modules were used.

I have been trying to find out a simple and powerful solution for React unit test. After spending some time on trying on it, I felt that this solution wasn't simple enough.
